Age plays a very big role in fertility. Many people think they have time, but body doesn't wait forever. In women, the number and quality of eggs starts going down after 30, and even faster after 35. After 40, it becomes harder to get pregnant naturally and even IVF becomes more tricky.

Thatâ€™s because when eggs get old, chances of making healthy embryo goes down. Also, older eggs may have more chromosomal problems, which can cause miscarriage or failed IVF.

In men, age affects sperm too, but not as fast. Still, after 40-45, sperm quality and motility (movement) can go down. Also, DNA damage in sperm increases, which affects embryo quality.

So, couples should not wait too long. If you're over 30 and trying for more than 6 months with no result, better to check with fertility doctor.

The good news is, IVF can still work with proper tests, good lab, and personalised treatment. Some women also freeze eggs before 35 for future use. And men can improve sperm quality with healthy lifestyle and supplements.
